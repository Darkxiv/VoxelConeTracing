This is a simple DX11.1 render engine created to study modern graphics technologies. Particularly Voxel Cone Tracing.
It's easy to use. It has a basic obj/mtl loader, supports static scene, uses effect11 framework and precompiled fx-shaders.
I have added abstracting comments and draw several schemes to simplify codes reading.
If you'd like to program any technique you can start from DefaultShader and RenderTick.
